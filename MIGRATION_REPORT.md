# Quantum Package Migration Report

## Phase 1 Migration Summary

*Date: May 12, 2025*
*Updated: May 12, 2025 - Session 2*

## Migration Checklist

### Phase 1: Package Structure and Quantum Migration
- [x] Create packages/quantum directory structure
- [x] Create package.json and build configuration files
- [x] Create tsconfig.json for TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create core directory structure (core, states, operators, utils)
- [x] Migrate files from lib/quantum to packages/quantum
- [x] Update imports in all migrated files
- [x] Create proper index.ts with all necessary exports
- [x] Create migration report with detailed summary
- [x] Update imports in test files
- [x] Update imports in example files
- [x] Run tests with new structure
- [x] Run examples with new structure
- [x] Test build process for the package
- [ ] Fix remaining test and build errors *(next session)*

### Phase 2: Abstract Graph Implementation
- [ ] Create packages/graph-core directory structure
- [ ] Implement AbstractGraph class
- [ ] Create graph algorithms and utility functions
- [ ] Implement comprehensive tests

### Phase 3: Tensor Core Implementation
- [ ] Create packages/tensor-core directory structure
- [ ] Implement core tensor interfaces and operations
- [ ] Create intertwiner tensor functionality
- [ ] Build tensor manipulation utilities

### Phase 4: Spin Network Integration
- [ ] Create packages/spin-network directory structure
- [ ] Implement EdgeStateVector for quantum states on edges
- [ ] Create IntertwinerNode implementation
- [ ] Build GraphStateComposer for state composition

### Phase 5: Documentation and Examples
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Build educational examples
- [ ] Create migration guides
- [ ] Update existing documentation

### üìÇ Directory Structure Created
- `/packages/quantum/` - Main package directory
- `/packages/quantum/src/core/` - Core types and definitions
- `/packages/quantum/src/states/` - State vector implementations
- `/packages/quantum/src/operators/` - Quantum operators and gates
- `/packages/quantum/src/utils/` - Utility functions and operations
- `/packages/quantum/__tests__/` - Tests migrated from lib/quantum

### üìÑ Configuration Files Created
- `package.json` - Package definition for @spin-network/quantum
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `README.md` - Package documentation

### üîç Migration Process
- Preserved all original files from lib/quantum with their original content
- Reorganized into a more logical structure based on implementation plan
- Updated imports to reflect new directory structure
- Fixed complex number implementation to consistently use math.js

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
- The circuit.ts implementation is still pending (related to task T61)
- Some TypeScript errors may persist until comprehensive testing is performed
- Imports in test files may need additional updates

### üìã Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Implement AbstractGraph class in packages/graph-core
- Set up graph-core package structure
- Create graph algorithms and utility functions
- Implement tests for graph-core functionality
