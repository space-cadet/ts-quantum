## Focus Task
T5: Generate Interactive Webpages for ts-quantum Library
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Active
**Time Spent**: 45 minutes

## Tasks Worked On
### T5: Generate Interactive Webpages for ts-quantum Library
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Progress Made**:
- Improved layout of basic-gates.html demo by moving quantum gates above visualization
- Aligned phase circles directly above corresponding amplitude bars with proper spacing
- Added static code display box showing essential ts-quantum API usage patterns
- Moved all inline CSS to external stylesheet for better organization
- Fixed styling issues after CSS migration (canvas background, layout)
**Status Change**: ðŸ”„ Active â†’ ðŸ”„ Active (progressing)

## Files Modified
- `docs/examples/basic-gates.html` - Layout reorganization, phase circle alignment, code display addition
- `docs/examples/styles/basic-gates.css` - Consolidated all styling from inline to external file
- `memory-bank/tasks/T5.md` - Updated progress tracking and timestamps
- `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Added T5 entry with status and progress notes

## Key Decisions Made
- Credited Claude 3.5 for creating original demo, Claude 4 for layout improvements
- Used static code display rather than dynamic updates to show ts-quantum API
- Reorganized page flow: gates first, then visualization results

## Context for Next Session
T5 continues with Bell states interactive example as next deliverable. Basic gates demo now has improved UX with better visual hierarchy and educational code examples.

## Next Session Priorities
1. Create Bell states interactive demonstration page
2. Design angular momentum coupling visualization
3. Plan time evolution demo structure
