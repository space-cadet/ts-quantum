# Project Brief: ts-quantum
*Last Updated: 2025-07-06 17:53:45 IST*

## Overview
ts-quantum is a standalone TypeScript library for quantum mechanics calculations and utilities, extracted from the spin-network-app project to be published as an independent npm package.

## Purpose
Create a comprehensive, standalone quantum mechanics library in TypeScript that provides:
- Quantum state vector operations
- Standard quantum gates and operators
- Density matrix operations and measurements
- Angular momentum algebra and Wigner symbols
- Quantum information tools
- Geometric quantum calculations

## Scope
- **Core functionality**: Quantum states, operators, gates, measurements
- **Mathematical tools**: Angular momentum, Wigner symbols, matrix operations
- **Utilities**: Information theory, oscillator functions, geometry
- **Target users**: Researchers, students, developers working with quantum mechanics
- **Platform**: TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js >= 14.0.0

## Key Requirements
- Zero dependencies on workspace packages
- Clean, well-documented API
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Ready for npm publishing
- Professional documentation

## Current Status
- Extracted from packages/quantum in spin-network-app
- Removed graph-core dependencies
- Package configuration updated for standalone release
- Build errors need resolution before publishing
