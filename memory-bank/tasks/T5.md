# T5: Generate Interactive Webpages for ts-quantum Library
*Last Updated: 2025-07-07 20:16:32 IST*

**Description**: Create interactive HTML webpages in the docs/ folder that demonstrate the use of the ts-quantum library through live examples and visualizations.
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Active
**Priority**: MEDIUM

**Dependencies**: T4 (completed)

## Completion Criteria
- Interactive webpage showing basic quantum gates and state operations
- Examples page demonstrating Bell state creation and measurement
- Angular momentum coupling visualization with Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
- Time evolution demo showing quantum dynamics and interference
- All pages use the published ts-quantum npm package (version 0.9.0)
- Pages work offline and include mathematical explanations

## Related Files
- `docs/examples/basic-gates.html`
- `docs/examples/bell-states.html`
- `docs/examples/angular-momentum.html`
- `docs/examples/time-evolution.html`
- `docs/index.html` (update to link to examples)

## Progress
1. âœ… Task created with clear scope
2. âœ… Design webpage structure and approach
3. âœ… Create basic gates demonstration page (original by Claude 3.5)
4. âœ… Improve basic gates layout and add code display
5. ðŸ”„ Create Bell states interactive example
6. â¬œ Create angular momentum coupling visualization
7. â¬œ Create time evolution demonstration (replacing random walk)
8. â¬œ Update main docs index page with links

## Context
The ts-quantum library is now published to npm and needs interactive demonstrations that show its capabilities. These should be educational webpages that can run in a browser, import the library from CDN, and provide both visual and mathematical explanations of quantum mechanics concepts.
